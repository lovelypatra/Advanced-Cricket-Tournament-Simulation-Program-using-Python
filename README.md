Methodology Used:

The methodology used to develop the cricket tournament simulation program involved creating different classes to represent various entities involved in a cricket match. The key classes included:

Player: Represents a player with batting, bowling, fielding, running, and experience stats.

Teams: Represents a team with a list of players, batting order, and bowlers.

Field: Represents the field conditions, size, fan ratio, etc.

Umpire: Handles ball outcome predictions, scoring, wickets, and over counting.

Commentator: Provides commentary based on match statistics.

Match: Simulates an individual cricket match using the above classes.

The program is designed to simulate a T20 cricket match, but it can be extended to support other formats like ODI or Test by modifying the number of overs and other parameters.

Instructions to Run the Code:

To run the cricket tournament simulation program, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

Copy the entire code provided in the previous responses and save it to a file named app.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the app.py file.

Run the program by executing the command: python app.py

The program will prompt you to enter the match format (T20, ODI, Test).

Next, you will be prompted to enter the details of each team. For each team, provide the number of players and then enter the details of each player, such as name, batting rating, bowling rating, fielding rating, running rating, and experience rating.

The simulation will start, and you will see commentary for each ball and over, along with match statistics.

The match will continue until both teams finish batting, and the result will be displayed at the end.

You can repeat the process to simulate multiple matches with different teams and field conditions.
